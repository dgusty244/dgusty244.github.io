  <h1 class="title" style="text-align:center;">Sportsbook App in Python</h1>

  <p><em>Online sports betting is illegal in Washington State, so I built my own sportsbook using Python.</em></p>

  <p>
    About 2.5 years ago, before I had even heard of ChatGPT, I created a personal betting tracker. It wasn’t about making money; I just wanted to answer the question: <strong>If I were risking money, would I be winning?</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    I built the original version in Google Colab, the IDE I was most comfortable with at the time. It was a single long <code>.ipynb</code> notebook, not something I ever expected to share, just a tool for myself.
  </p>

  <p>
    More recently, I decided to turn it into a real software project. Key changes included:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Migrated the codebase to <strong>VS Code</strong></li>
    <li>Broke the notebook into separate <code>.py</code> files</li>
    <li>Used <strong>Git Bash</strong> for version control—creating feature branches, committing changes, and merging into <code>main</code> on GitHub</li>
    <li>Treated <code>.csv</code> files like lightweight database tables to persist user data</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The app now tracks:
    <ul>
      <li>User deposits and bet amounts</li>
      <li>Win/loss outcomes and current balances</li>
    </ul>
    It’s still lightweight, but I plan to build additional features like:
    <ul>
      <li>Separate user balances and bet histories</li>
      <li>Input validation (e.g., disallowing bets above available balance)</li>
      <li>Automatically pulling game results via API or web scraping</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

    Building this project helped me understand not just Python scripting, but how to structure and persist state in a way that mimics real app behavior. It’s also reminded me that if you want to learn something, the best path is to start building.
